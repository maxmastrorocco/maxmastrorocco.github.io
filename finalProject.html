       This is Max's Final Project for CSC106 at the University of Rhode Island! Him and his partner, Jason Carroll, created a Maze game in which you must direct the character through the maze within the given time in order to pass the level. This program contains a wonderful splash screen, level selector, instructions, as well as a credit screen in adddition to the game itself. 
        
There are ######## levels that include beautifully wrritten scenery. Jason and I spent a month making this, we hope you enjoy!!
        
        INSTRUCTIONS: You can either start from level 1-1 and play through, or use the level selector to play a level of your choice. With the use of the WASD keys for movement you can seamlessly navigate the character through the level. Stuck on beating the level in time? Use the pick ups to add extra time on the clock!
