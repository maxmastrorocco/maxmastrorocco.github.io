        Hello everyone! My name is Maxwell Mastrorocco and I am currently a Sophomore at the Univeristy of Rhode Island. I study business and computer science. I have never taken any computer science courses before, I am <em><strong>incredily</strong</em> excited to start them! I enjoy playing soccer and am an active member of the greek life community.
